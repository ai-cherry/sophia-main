## Performance Architecture

### Sub-Second Response Strategy
```python
# Parallel processing for maximum speed
async def executive_search(query, mode="combined"):
    if mode in ["internal", "combined"]:
        internal_results = await parallel_search([
            vector_search(query),           # Pinecone knowledge
            operational_search(query),      # Snowflake data
            agent_memory_search(query),     # Strategic history
            live_agent_synthesis(query)     # Real-time intelligence
        ])
    
    if mode in ["external", "combined"]:
        external_results = await parallel_search([
            apify_proptech_search(query),   # Industry-focused
            huggingface_analysis(query),    # AI model insights
            competitive_intel(query),       # Market intelligence
            regulatory_search(query)        # Compliance updates
        ])
    
    return synthesize_executive_response(internal_results, external_results)
```

### Context Window Optimization
- 200K+ token conversations with intelligent compression
- Strategic context prioritization
- Dynamic context expansion/contraction
- Cross-session context persistence

## Model Selection Intelligence

### Query Analysis Engine
```python
async def _select_optimal_model(query: str, context_size: int = 0) -> str:
    """Intelligently select optimal model based on query analysis"""
    
    # Analyze query characteristics
    query_type = analyze_query_intent(query)
    
    # Map to optimal model
    model_mapping = {
        "strategic_analysis": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
        "quick_response": "openai/gpt-4-turbo",
        "deep_analysis": "openai/o1-preview",
        "code_generation": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
        "cost_optimized": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct"
    }
    
    return await select_with_fallback(model_mapping[query_type])
```

### Performance Tracking
```python
class ModelPerformanceMetrics:
    model_id: str
    avg_response_time: float
    avg_quality_score: float
