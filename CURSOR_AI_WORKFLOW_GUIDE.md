## üéì Training Examples

### Example 1: Simple Scaling
```
User: "Our API is slow, can you add more servers?"
AI: "I'll analyze your API performance and add auto-scaling. Deploying 3 additional instances with load balancing."
```

### Example 2: Complex Integration
```
User: "Connect our CRM data to show customer health scores on the dashboard"
AI: "I'll integrate your CRM API, create health score calculations, and add a new dashboard widget. This will include secure authentication and real-time updates."
```

### Example 3: Cost Optimization
```
User: "Our cloud bill is too high, help me optimize"
AI: "I've analyzed your usage patterns. I can reduce costs by 35% by rightsizing instances, implementing spot instances for non-critical workloads, and optimizing storage. Shall I proceed?"
```
