# Dynamic MCP Strategy for Sophia AI

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a pragmatic approach to expanding MCP integration beyond basic service connections to create a dynamic, AI-driven development and operations platform. The strategy focuses on practical improvements without over-engineering.

## Core Philosophy

**"Make the complex simple, not the simple complex"**

- Leverage MCP as a universal interface layer
- Enable AI agents to perform complex tasks through simple tool calls
- Maintain human oversight while automating repetitive work
- Build incrementally with immediate value at each stage

## 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Dynamic Management

### Current State

## Conclusion

This MCP strategy transforms Sophia AI from a collection of integrations into an intelligent, self-managing platform. By focusing on practical improvements and avoiding over-engineering, we can deliver immediate value while building toward a more autonomous future.

The key is to start with the foundations (Snowflake, Pinecone, Pulumi) and progressively add intelligence through MCP servers that understand context, optimize automatically, and enable AI agents to perform complex operations through simple interfaces.

**Next Step**: Deploy the Snowflake MCP server and validate the architecture before expanding to other services.
