        This dashboard will be composed of several key components:
        
        1.  **KPI Grid:** A series of cards displaying real-time Key Performance Indicators.
            -   Data Source: A new endpoint, e.g., `/api/v1/ceo/kpis`.
            -   Metrics: Revenue, New Deals, Client Health Score, Agent Success Rate.

        2.  **Portkey LLM Metrics:** A section to display core observability data from the Portkey gateway.
            -   Data Source: A new endpoint that calls the Portkey API, e.g., `/api/v1/monitoring/portkey-stats`.
            -   Metrics: Total Cost, Requests per Model, Average Latency, Error Rate.
            -   Visualization: Could be a mix of metric cards and charts.

        3.  **Agno Agent Interaction:** A simple interface to interact with a high-level "Executive Agent".
            -   Component: A chat input box or a task submission form.
            -   Functionality: Allows the CEO to ask questions or delegate tasks directly from the dashboard.
            -   Backend: Uses the `/agno/task` endpoint.

        4.  **Arize Agent Performance:** A view to show the quality and performance of key agents.
            -   Data Source: A new endpoint that calls the Arize API, e.g., `/api/v1/monitoring/arize-scores`.
            -   Metrics: "LLM-as-a-judge" quality scores, hallucination rates, tool usage success.
            -   Visualization: A trend line chart showing quality over time.
            
        5.  **Strategic Alerts:** A list of high-priority alerts generated by agents.
            -   Data Source: A WebSocket connection or a polling GET request to an alerts endpoint.
            -   Content: Opportunities (e.g., "High-value lead detected") or Risks (e.g., "Key account churn risk").
