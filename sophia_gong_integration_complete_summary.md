```

### **API Endpoints (Flask)**
```
GET  /api/health                    -- Health check and system status
GET  /api/conversations/search      -- Search conversations with filters
GET  /api/conversations/{call_id}   -- Get detailed conversation data
GET  /api/dashboard/stats           -- Dashboard statistics and metrics
POST /api/emails/upload             -- Manual email upload functionality
```
