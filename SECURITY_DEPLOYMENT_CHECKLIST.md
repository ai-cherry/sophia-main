- [ ] **Vector Database Security**
  - [ ] Secure Pinecone and Weaviate with API keys
  - [ ] Implement namespace isolation for multi-tenant data
  - [ ] Verify vector data doesn't contain raw PII

## üîç Code Security

- [ ] **Dependency Scanning**
  - [ ] Run `safety check` on all dependencies
  - [ ] Update dependencies with known vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Verify no development dependencies in production

- [ ] **Static Code Analysis**
  - [ ] Run `bandit` on all Python code
  - [ ] Address all high and medium severity issues
  - [ ] Verify no secrets in code comments

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - [ ] Verify all API inputs are validated
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
  - [ ] Test with malformed inputs

## üîí Infrastructure Security

- [ ] **Docker Security**
  - [ ] Run containers as non-root users
  - [ ] Use minimal base images
  - [ ] Scan container images for vulnerabilities

- [ ] **Network Security**
  - [ ] Configure CORS properly
  - [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid certificates
  - [ ] Implement proper network segmentation

- [ ] **Cloud Security**
  - [ ] Follow principle of least privilege for IAM roles
  - [ ] Enable logging for all services
  - [ ] Configure security groups to restrict access

## üìù Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] **Logging**
  - [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not logged
  - [ ] Verify logs are stored securely
  - [ ] Implement log rotation

- [ ] **Monitoring**
  - [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activities
  - [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
  - [ ] Configure performance monitoring

## üö® Incident Response

- [ ] **Response Plan**
  - [ ] Document incident response procedures
  - [ ] Assign roles and responsibilities
  - [ ] Test incident response plan

- [ ] **Backup & Recovery**
  - [ ] Verify automated backups are working
  - [ ] Test restoration procedures
  - [ ] Document recovery time objectives

## üîÑ Continuous Security

- [ ] **CI/CD Security**
  - [ ] Implement security checks in CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Verify deployment artifacts are signed
  - [ ] Ensure secrets are not exposed in CI/CD logs
  - [ ] Confirm GitHub Actions workflows use secrets securely
  - [ ] Verify GitHub Actions workflows have appropriate permissions
  - [ ] Test deployment with GitHub Actions before production release

- [ ] **Security Testing**
  - [ ] Conduct regular penetration testing
  - [ ] Perform security code reviews
  - [ ] Run automated security scans

## üìú Compliance

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update security documentation
  - [ ] Document data flow and storage
  - [ ] Maintain list of third-party services

- [ ] **Policies**
  - [ ] Review and update security policies
  - [ ] Ensure compliance with relevant regulations
  - [ ] Verify data processing agreements are in place

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

- [ ] **Pre-Deployment Review**
  - [ ] Conduct final security review
  - [ ] Verify all checklist items are completed
  - [ ] Obtain approval from security team

- [ ] **Post-Deployment Verification**
  - [ ] Verify security configurations in production
  - [ ] Run security scans on deployed environment
  - [ ] Monitor for unusual activities
