# Retool Integration Strategy for Sophia AI

## üéØ **Vision: AI-Generated Admin Interfaces**

This document outlines the strategy for integrating **Retool** into the Sophia AI ecosystem. Our vision is to empower AI agents like Cursor AI to **programmatically build and manage internal administrative dashboards**.

By leveraging Retool's low-code UI builder via an API and exposing it through a dedicated **Retool MCP Server**, we are creating a powerful new capability: AI-driven internal tool development.

This aligns perfectly with the **Docker MCP Catalog and Toolkit** paradigm by creating a standardized, containerized, and discoverable "Retool building block" for our AI agents.

## üöÄ **Core Use Cases**

The Retool MCP server will enable AI agents to automate the creation of critical internal tools.

### 1. **Live MCP Server Monitoring Dashboard**
- **User Story**: "As a developer, I want to ask Sophia to create a dashboard that shows the real-time health and status of all running MCP servers."
- **AI Action**:
    1. The AI agent calls `retool.create_admin_dashboard(dashboard_name='mcp_server_status')`.
    2. The agent then iterates through all configured MCP servers.
    3. For each server, it calls a (future) tool `retool.add_health_status_card(app_id, server_name)`, which adds a UI component to the dashboard configured to poll the server's `/health` endpoint.
- **Outcome**: A developer gets a live Retool dashboard in seconds without writing any frontend code.

### 2. **Knowledge Base Management UI**
- **User Story**: "As a business user, I need a simple UI to manually upload, view, and delete documents in our Pay Ready Knowledge Base."
- **AI Action**:
    1. The agent calls `retool.create_admin_dashboard(dashboard_name='knowledge_base_manager')`.
    2. It adds a table component connected to the `knowledge_mcp_server` to list documents.
    3. It adds buttons for "Upload" and "Delete" that trigger the respective tools on the `knowledge_mcp_server`.
- **Outcome**: A fully functional content management system for our vector database, created on demand.

### 3. **AI Memory Inspector**
- **User Story**: "As an AI developer, I want to inspect the conversations being stored in the AI Memory system to improve its performance."
- **AI Action**:
    1. The agent calls `retool.create_admin_dashboard(dashboard_name='ai_memory_inspector')`.
    2. It adds a searchable table that uses the `ai_memory.recall_memory` tool to display stored conversations.
    3. It adds a "Delete" button for each entry, calling `ai_memory.delete_memory`.
- **Outcome**: A powerful debugging and administration tool for our AI's own memory.

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

The integration follows our standard, scalable MCP architecture.

![Retool MCP Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/example.png)  <!-- Conceptual image -->

1.  **AI Agent (e.g., Cursor AI)**: The agent uses natural language to request a dashboard. It has access to the `retool` toolset via the MCP client.
2.  **MCP Gateway**: Routes requests for the `retool` service to the correct container.
3.  **Retool MCP Server (Docker Container)**: A dedicated, containerized Python process running the `retool_mcp_server.py` script. It listens for requests from the gateway.
4.  **Retool Integration Client**: The server uses the `retool_integration.py` client to handle the business logic of talking to the Retool API.
5.  **Pulumi ESC**: The `RETOOL_API_TOKEN` is securely fetched from Pulumi ESC by the integration client at runtime.
6.  **Retool API**: The external Retool service that builds the UI.

## üê≥ **Alignment with Docker MCP Catalog**

This implementation is the first step towards realizing the "Docker MCP Catalog" vision:

- **Standardized**: The `RetoolMCPServer` inherits from `BaseMCPServer`, ensuring it follows our standard protocol.
- **Containerized**: It runs in a dedicated Docker container (`Dockerfile.retool_mcp`) and is managed via `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Discoverable**: It's registered in `mcp_config.json`, making it automatically discoverable by the gateway and any connected AI agent.
- **Scalable**: As a container, it can be scaled independently using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes if needed.
- **Shareable**: We could, in the future, publish this `sophia-retool-mcp` image to a private Docker registry, creating our own internal MCP Catalog.

## üîí **Security**

- The `RETOOL_API_TOKEN` is managed securely through Pulumi ESC and is never hardcoded.
- The Retool MCP server runs in an isolated container, minimizing its access to other parts of the system.
- All interactions are funneled through the MCP gateway, which can enforce central authentication and logging in the future.
