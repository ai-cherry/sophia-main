# üéØ CURSOR IDE + CLAUDE + PULUMI IaC NATURAL LANGUAGE COMMAND GUIDE

## üöÄ **OVERVIEW: NATURAL LANGUAGE INFRASTRUCTURE CONTROL**

Your Sophia AI system integrates Claude MCP servers with Cursor IDE to enable **natural language infrastructure commands**. You can now direct Pulumi IaC, manage cloud resources, and control deployments using conversational commands.

## üîß **CURSOR IDE SETUP FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE COMMANDS**
