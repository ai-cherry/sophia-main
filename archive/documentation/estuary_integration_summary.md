# Estuary Integration Work Summary

## Work Completed

1. **Documentation Update**
   - Updated the Estuary API URL in `docs/INTEGRATION_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` from `https://api.estuary.dev` to `https://api.estuary.tech`

2. **Configuration Verification**
   - Verified that the correct URL (`https://api.estuary.tech`) is already set in:
     - `test_integrations.py`
     - `backend/integrations/estuary_flow_integration.py`
     - `.env` file
     - `integration.env.example`

3. **Testing**
   - Ran integration tests to verify connectivity
   - Identified persistent issues with the Estuary API connection

## Unresolved Issues

1. **API Connection Error**
   - Despite having the correct URL in configuration files, the test is still trying to connect to `api.estuary.dev`
   - Error message: `Cannot connect to host api.estuary.dev:443 ssl:default [nodename nor servname provided, or not known]`

2. **SSL Certificate Verification Issues**
   - All API connections (Gong, Snowflake, Estuary, Vercel) are failing with SSL certificate verification errors
   - Example: `SSLCertVerificationError: (1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:1006)')]`

3. **Authentication Issues**
   - Snowflake connection requires multi-factor authentication

## Next Steps

1. Debug why the system is still trying to connect to `api.estuary.dev` despite configuration updates
2. Resolve SSL certificate verification issues for all API connections
3. Update authentication methods for Snowflake to handle MFA requirements
4. Implement proper error handling for API connection failures
