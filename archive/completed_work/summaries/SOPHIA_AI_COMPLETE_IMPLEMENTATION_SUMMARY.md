## 📊 Executive Dashboard Implementation

### What Was Deployed

#### Backend API Server
- **Technology**: FastAPI with async support
- **Port**: 8000
- **Features**:
  - Real-time executive metrics
  - AI-powered insights
  - WebSocket support
  - CORS enabled

#### API Endpoints
1. **`/api/executive/summary`**
   - Revenue metrics ($2.5M current, $3M target)
   - Customer analytics (150 total, 12 new, 2% churn)
   - Operations metrics (92% efficiency, 8% cost reduction)
   - AI insights (5 opportunities, 2 risks, 3 recommendations)

2. **`/api/executive/alerts`**
   - High-value lead notifications
   - Customer churn warnings
   - Performance threshold alerts
   - AI-detected opportunities
