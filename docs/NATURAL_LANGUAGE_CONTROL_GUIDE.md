- **Be Specific**: Include relevant context and parameters
- **Use Clear Language**: Avoid ambiguous terms or phrases
- **Provide Context**: Specify timeframes, resources, and scope
- **Confirm Actions**: Review system responses before proceeding

#### Command Examples
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "Show me Gong conversation analysis for deals closed this week"
- ‚ùå **Poor**: "Show me some data"
- ‚úÖ **Good**: "Deploy a React application with PostgreSQL database and Redis caching"
- ‚ùå **Poor**: "Deploy something"

### System Interaction

#### Monitoring Responses
- **Review Confirmations**: Always check system responses for accuracy
- **Monitor Progress**: Watch for completion confirmations
- **Verify Results**: Confirm operations completed successfully
- **Report Issues**: Immediately report any unexpected behaviors

#### Performance Optimization
- **Use Specific Queries**: Targeted commands perform better than broad requests
- **Batch Operations**: Combine related operations when possible
- **Monitor Resource Usage**: Be aware of system capacity and limitations
