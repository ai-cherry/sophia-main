## üîÑ Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failure, follow these steps to rollback:

1. Stop all containers
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile production down
   ```

2. Rollback database migrations
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```

3. Deploy previous version
   ```bash
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   docker-compose --profile production up -d
   ```
