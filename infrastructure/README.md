# Sophia AI Pay Ready Infrastructure

This document provides an overview of the infrastructure required to deploy the
Sophia AI Pay Ready Platform on Lambda Labs. Due to repository constraints this
is a condensed version of the full documentation.

## System Architecture Overview

Sophia AI consists of a Flask backend, a React frontend and supporting services
(PostgreSQL, Redis, Pinecone and Weaviate). Docker Compose orchestrates local
development while production runs on virtual machines at 150.136.94.139.

## Deployment Procedures

1. Clone the repository and install Docker.
2. Configure environment variables in `.env`.
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start services.
4. Point your domain to the server and configure SSL via Nginx.

## Monitoring and Health Checks

Prometheus and Grafana are included in the compose stack for basic monitoring.
Health endpoints are exposed via `/api/health` on the Flask app.

## Security Configuration

All external connections require TLS. API keys should be stored securely using
environment variables or a secrets manager. Database access is restricted to the
application network.

## Backup and Recovery

Regular PostgreSQL backups should be scheduled using `pg_dump`. Redis snapshot
files should be archived periodically. Vector indexes can be recreated from
source data if necessary.

For detailed instructions on tuning, troubleshooting and maintenance, refer to
the full infrastructure guide located in company documentation.
