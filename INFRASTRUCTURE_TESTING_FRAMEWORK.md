## ✅ Testing Layers Implemented

### 1. **Unit Tests**
- Individual component validation
- Resource creation verification
- Configuration testing
- Environment-specific naming validation

### 2. **Integration Tests**
- Service connectivity validation
- Data flow testing (Gong → Snowflake)
- API integration verification
- Cross-component functionality

### 3. **End-to-End Tests**
- Complete infrastructure deployment
- System health validation
- Full stack functionality testing
- Component interconnectivity verification

### 4. **Performance Tests**
- Query response time validation (< 2.0s for Snowflake)
- Vector search performance (< 0.1s for Pinecone)
- Webhook processing speed (< 0.5s for Gong)
- Scalability testing (100K+ records, 50K+ vectors)
- Concurrent load handling

### 5. **Security Tests**
- Secret management validation
- Access control verification
- Network security configuration
- Vulnerability scanning

## 🚀 Key Features

### Automated Test Execution
```bash
# Quick unit tests only
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py --quick

# Full test suite including security
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py --full

# Parallel execution for speed
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py --parallel --workers 8

# With coverage reporting
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py --coverage
```

### CI/CD Integration
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/infrastructure-tests.yml`
- Automatic testing on push/PR
- Daily scheduled security scans
- Performance regression detection
- Slack notifications on failure

### Mock Infrastructure
- Pulumi runtime mocking for unit tests
- Service client mocks (Snowflake, Pinecone, Gong)
- Test environment isolation
- Fixture-based test data

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

| Component | Operation | Threshold | Test Coverage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Snowflake | Query Execution | < 2.0s | ✅ Single & Concurrent |
| Pinecone | Vector Search | < 0.1s | ✅ Single & Batch |
| Gong | Webhook Processing | < 0.5s | ✅ Single & Burst |
| E2E Pipeline | Data Flow | < 5.0s | ✅ Complete Flow |

## 🔒 Security Validation

- **Pulumi ESC Integration**: Secure secret management
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions testing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Bandit & Safety integration
- **Compliance Checks**: Infrastructure security best practices

## 🎨 Test Examples

### Unit Test Example
```python
def test_snowflake_database_creation(self, pulumi_mock, mock_pulumi_config):
    """Test that Snowflake database is created with correct configuration"""
    with pulumi_mock.mocked_provider():
        component = SnowflakeComponent("test-snowflake")
        pulumi_mock.assert_resource_created(
            "snowflake:index/database:Database",
            {"name": "SOPHIA_DB_TEST"}
        )
```

### Integration Test Example
```python
async def test_gong_to_snowflake_data_flow(self, mock_gong_client, mock_snowflake_client):
    """Test end-to-end data flow from Gong to Snowflake"""
    test_data = {"call_id": "test-123", "duration": 300}
    mock_gong_client.send_test_data(test_data)
    
    # Verify data appears in Snowflake
    result = mock_snowflake_client.query(
        f"SELECT * FROM gong_calls WHERE call_id = '{test_data['call_id']}'"
    )
    assert len(result) == 1
```

## 📈 Continuous Monitoring

### Health Checks
- Real-time service monitoring
- Automated alerting on failures
- Performance metric collection
- Resource utilization tracking

### Test Reports
