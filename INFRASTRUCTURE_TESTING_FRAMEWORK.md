## Test Structure

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/infrastructure/unit/`)

Test individual infrastructure components in isolation:

```python
# test_snowflake_component.py
class TestSnowflakeComponent:
    def test_database_creation(self):
        """Verify database and schema creation"""
        
    def test_table_structure(self):
        """Validate table schemas and constraints"""
        
    def test_connection_parameters(self):
        """Test connection configuration"""
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/infrastructure/integration/`)

Test service interconnections and data flow:

```python
# test_snowflake_gong_integration.py
class TestSnowflakeGongIntegration:
    def test_data_pipeline_flow(self):
        """Test Gong â†’ Snowflake data sync"""
        
    def test_data_transformation(self):
        """Validate data quality and completeness"""
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/infrastructure/e2e/`)

Test complete infrastructure deployment:

```python
# test_complete_infrastructure.py
class TestCompleteInfrastructure:
    def test_full_stack_deployment(self):
        """Deploy and validate entire infrastructure"""
        
    def test_ai_agent_functionality(self):
        """Test all AI agents with infrastructure"""
```

### 4. Performance Tests (`tests/infrastructure/performance/`)

Validate system performance and scalability:

```python
# test_performance.py
class TestPerformance:
    def test_query_performance(self):
        """Benchmark database query times"""
        
    def test_api_response_times(self):
        """Validate API latency requirements"""
        
    def test_concurrent_load(self):
        """Test system under concurrent load"""
```

## Running Tests

### Local Testing

```bash
# Run all infrastructure tests
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test category
pytest tests/infrastructure/unit/
pytest tests/infrastructure/integration/
pytest tests/infrastructure/e2e/
pytest tests/infrastructure/performance/

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/infrastructure/ --cov=infrastructure --cov-report=html
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

### Test Environment Management

```python
# Create isolated test environment
python tests/infrastructure/conftest.py create-test-env --name test-feature-x

# Run tests in isolated environment
python tests/infrastructure/run_all_tests.py --env test-feature-x

# Cleanup test environment
python tests/infrastructure/conftest.py cleanup-test-env --name test-feature-x
```

   # Reset test environment
   python tests/infrastructure/conftest.py reset-env
   ```

2. **Flaky Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run with retry logic
   pytest tests/infrastructure/ --reruns 3
   ```

3. **Performance Test Variations**
   ```bash
   # Run with extended timeout
   pytest tests/infrastructure/performance/ --timeout=300
   ```

## Integration with CI/CD
