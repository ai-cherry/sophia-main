John Smith: Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the call today. I wanted to discuss the pricing for the Pay Ready platform.

Sarah Johnson: Of course, John. I'm happy to go through the pricing with you. We have several options depending on your needs.

John Smith: Great. We're looking at about 500 units across 3 properties, so we need something that can scale.

Sarah Johnson: Perfect. For that scale, I'd recommend our Pay Ready Plus plan at $2.50 per unit per month. That would be about $1,250 monthly.

John Smith: That sounds reasonable. What about the implementation timeline?

Sarah Johnson: We can typically get you up and running within 2-3 weeks. The API integration is straightforward.

John Smith: Excellent. I think we're ready to move forward. Can you send over the contract?

Sarah Johnson: Absolutely! I'll have that sent to you by end of day. We're excited to have you on board.
